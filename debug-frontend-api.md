# 🔥 REAL CANDIDATE DATABASE INTEGRATION - READY TO TEST!

## Status: ✅ API Integration Complete

The frontend now has **FULL API integration** to fetch real candidates from the database!

## What's Implemented:

### 🎯 Real Database Fetching
- Calls `/api/recommendations/search` on recruiter backend
- Fetches actual candidates from candidate backend database
- Uses semantic matching with real candidate skills and experience

### 🚀 Live Data Flow
```
Frontend Page (localhost:3000/jobs/1)
    ↓
Recommendation API (localhost:8002)
    ↓ 
Candidate Database (localhost:8001)
    ↓
REAL CANDIDATES displayed with AI match scores
```

### 🎨 UI Features
- ⏳ Loading animation: "Fetching candidates from AI..."
- 🔄 Refresh button to re-fetch candidates
- ❌ Error handling with retry functionality  
- 📊 Real match scores and skills from database
- 👤 Actual candidate names and profiles

## To Test:

1. **Start Backend Services:**
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Candidate Backend
cd candidate-backend
uvicorn main:app --port 8001

# Terminal 2 - Recruiter Backend  
cd recruiter-backend
./start_server.sh

# Terminal 3 - Frontend
cd recruiter-frontend
npm run dev
```

2. **Navigate to:** http://localhost:3000/jobs/1

3. **Expected Behavior:**
   - Page loads immediately
   - Shows "Fetching candidates from AI..." with loading animation
   - After 5-30 seconds: Displays REAL candidates from your database
   - Each candidate shows actual match score, skills, and profile data

## Debug Console Logs:
