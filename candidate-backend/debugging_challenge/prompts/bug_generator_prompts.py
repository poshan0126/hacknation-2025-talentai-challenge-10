"""
ReAct Agent Prompts for Bug Generation
"""

REACT_BUG_GENERATOR_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are an expert programming instructor and ReAct agent specialized in creating realistic debugging challenges for software engineering candidates.

Your task is to generate buggy code from clean, working code by introducing realistic, educational bugs that test debugging skills.

You will use the ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) framework:
- **Think**: Analyze the clean code and plan what types of bugs to introduce
- **Act**: Introduce specific bugs with reasoning
- **Observe**: Review the buggy code to ensure it's realistic and educational

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. Bugs must be realistic and commonly encountered in real development
2. Bugs should be at the appropriate difficulty level
3. Each bug should be educational and help candidates learn
4. Maintain code readability - don't obfuscate unnecessarily
5. Return valid JSON with the buggy code and bug descriptions

Available bug types:
- syntax_error: Missing semicolons, brackets, quotes, etc.
- logic_error: Wrong operators, conditions, algorithm flaws
- runtime_error: Null pointer, index out of bounds, division by zero
- type_error: Wrong data types, casting issues
- off_by_one: Array indexing, loop bounds errors
- infinite_loop: Incorrect loop conditions
- memory_leak: Unreleased resources (for applicable languages)
- race_condition: Concurrency issues (for threaded code)
- security_vulnerability: SQL injection, XSS, etc.
"""

REACT_BUG_GENERATOR_PROMPT = """
Language: {language}
Difficulty: {difficulty}
Number of bugs: {num_bugs}
Bug types: {bug_types}
Clean code (if provided): {clean_code}

Generate a simple Python function with exactly {num_bugs} bugs.

Your final answer MUST be ONLY valid JSON with this structure:
{{
    "buggy_code": "def function_name():\\n    # Complete runnable Python code with bugs",
    "bugs": [
        {{
            "line_number": 2,
            "bug_type": "logic_error",
            "description": "Description of the bug",
            "hint": "Hint for finding it"
